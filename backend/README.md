Feature-Based Structure for Express.js is a way of organizing your application code based on the features of your application rather than the traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure. This approach helps in better organization of code, easier maintenance, and better scalability.

```
/backend
    /src
    /features
        /users
            /controllers
                users.controller.ts
            /models
                users.model.ts
            /routes
                users.routes.ts
        /products
            /controllers
                products.controller.ts
            /models
                products.model.ts
            /routes
                products.routes.ts
    /config
    config.js
    /middleware
    errorHandler.js
    /public
    /utils
    /services
    /tests
    app.ts
.gitignore
.env
package.json
tsconfig.json

```

The provided structure represents a well-organized approach for building an Express.js application using a feature-based architecture. 

Advantages of Feature-Based Structure

1. Scalability: As your application grows, you can easily add new features without impacting existing code.
2. Maintainability: Each feature is isolated, making it easier to understand, debug, and modify.
3. Testability: Features can be tested independently, leading to a more comprehensive test suite.
4. Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously without conflicts.
5. Code Organization: Enforces a clear separation of concerns, making your codebase more manageable.
